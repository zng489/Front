4. Run a Local Web Server
Since D3.js requires a web server to serve local files (to avoid issues like CORS when loading data), you'll need to run a simple server. Here's how you can do it:

Using Python (if you have Python installed):

If you have Python 3 installed, you can start a server by running:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m http.server
If you have Python 2, use:
bash
Copy code
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
This will serve the files in your directory at http://localhost:8000.
Using Node.js:

If you have Node.js installed, you can install a simple HTTP server package globally:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g http-server
Then, run the server:
bash
Copy code
http-server
This will serve your files at http://localhost:8080 by default.
